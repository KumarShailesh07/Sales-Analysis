📊 End-to-End Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

🧩 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Sales Analytics workflow built using Microsoft Excel.  
Raw transactional data has been transformed into a fully interactive business dashboard using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, KPI calculations, and trend analysis.

The goal of this project is to answer three key business questions:  
➤ Which products and cities generate the most revenue

➤ Which customers contribute the most and who are repeat buyers  

This project simulates how real businesses analyze sales data to support decision-making in marketing, inventory management, and customer retention.
